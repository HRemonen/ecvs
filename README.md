[Ecves](https://ecves.fly.dev/) is an online CV / job hunting platform.


## What
Users can create electronic CV's called "e-CV" that are used to apply for jobs opened by companies 
on the platform.


## Why
Because automated CV screening is a thing and it can get a bit messy. Maybe the screeners are bad 
or maybe the CV's are bad.

Using Ecves you are quaranteed to get the e-CV in a JSON format that does not need any more parsing
or anything like that. Companies can use the JSON format as they wish.

There is also huge advantage to the applicants, because there is no error in the data "screening".
