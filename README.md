[Ecves](https://ecves.fly.dev/) is an online CV / job hunting platform.


## Overview
Welcome to our job seeking platform! Our goal is to make the job application process as easy and efficient as possible for both job seekers and employers.

## Core Functionalities
Electronic Resumes (ecv's): Users can create as many ecv's as they like and save them on our platform. 
Ecv's are provided to employers in JSON format, which ensures that all resumes are in a standardized and easily parseable format. 
This eliminates the need for an AI screening process and reduces the likelihood of errors in the resume review process.

Job Posting: 
Employers can post job openings on our platform and specify the necessary qualifications and skills as usual.

Application: 
Job seekers can browse through available job postings and apply using one of their saved ecv's.

## Why I Built This Platform
I saw a need for a more streamlined and efficient job application process. Traditional resumes can be time-consuming to create and often require extensive formatting. 
By providing a platform for creating and storing ecv's in a standardized format, we aim to make the job search process quicker and easier for job seekers.

I also wanted to provide a platform for employers to easily find qualified candidates. By eliminating the need for an AI screening process and providing resumes in a standardized format, 
I aim to make it easier for employers to review resumes and find the best fit for their open positions.
